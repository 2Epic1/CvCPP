The C vs. CPP Project

This project is to help determine the efficiency of C++ when compared to C in 
embedded systems. There is currently only one project planned- a string to 
Morse code translator that blinks the RGB LED on the KL25 Freedom board.

Results will be posted on Microcontrollercentral.com when finished.

Stay tuned for more anecdotal evidence!
